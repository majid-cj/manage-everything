we face configurations problems daily, and we got stuck with searching on google
about the best way to configure certain service or run install something, and sometimes
i face the same problem more than one and i have to re-do my searches again, and i think
many of us have faced the same thing too, so i hope this repo could help, even if a little
bit, to solve some of these problems with real life cases, if you liked this idea you can
fork it or push your configuration.md file and share the knowledge .
